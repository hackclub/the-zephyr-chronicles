On board the Hacker Zephyr passengers must make 500 ships or else their home directories on the Zephyrnet will be destroyed ðŸ’¥

These 500 ships will form the Zephyr Chronicles.

The Zephyr Chronicles was built of [Scrapbook](https://github.com/hackclub/scrapbook). It uses Prisma & an SQLite3 database to store date instead of Airtable and has a custom theme made using [98.css](https://jdan.github.io/98.css/). It also has a custom upload flow made for the Zephyr.

The final Zephyr Chronicles will be published at [zephyr.hackclub.com/](https://zephyr.hackclub.com/).
